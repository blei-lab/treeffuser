# Treffuser Public Site

This folder contains all of the code pertaining the public site of Treffuser.
We use jekyll to generate the site and github actions to deploy it to github pages.
The folder name is `docs` because github pages only allows the root folder or the `docs` folder
to be used as the source for the site.
